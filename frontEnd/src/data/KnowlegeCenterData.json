The chunky seatpost design means you can’t use a suspension seatpost or seatpost-mounted accessories like cargo trailers or racks. The included fenders can be finicky to install, and the grips are not very comfortable. Additionally, the lack of closed loops on the frame can make locking up feel less secure, although there are ways to mitigate this with a good lock and anti-theft system.",
